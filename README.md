# SL Tech EdTech Backend System

## Project Overview
This project, developed as part of the Caltech AI and Machine Learning Bootcamp (July 2024 cohort), demonstrates the creation of a comprehensive backend system for a fictional EdTech company, SL Tech. It marks my first experience with Python programming, showcasing the application of extensive programming and object-oriented design principles from other languages to a new environment.

## Key Features
- User Management: Create, update, and validate user credentials
- Course Management: Add, remove, and list courses
- Enrollment Management: Enroll learners, track enrollments, manage dropouts
- Integrated Backend: Centralized system for managing all operations

## Project Structure
- `Classes_Definitions.ipynb`: Core class definitions (SLTechUser, SLTechLearner, SLTechInstructor, SLTechCourse, SLTechEnrollment)
- `Backend_Integration.ipynb`: Integration of core classes into a cohesive backend system
- `User_Input_Handling.ipynb`: Implementation of user input handling methods
- `Integration_Testing.ipynb`: Comprehensive testing of the entire system
- `Documentation_and_Review.ipynb`: Project limitations and potential improvements

## Technical Skills Demonstrated
- Rapid adaptation to Python programming
- Object-oriented design and implementation
- System architecture and integration
- Test case development and execution

## Industry Application
This project combines 15 years of EdTech industry experience with programming expertise to create a robust, scalable backend system addressing real-world educational platform needs. It serves as a foundation for future integration of advanced AI and ML concepts in educational technology systems.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed
3. Open the notebooks in order:
   - Start with `Classes_Definitions.ipynb`
   - Proceed to `Backend_Integration.ipynb`
   - Then `User_Input_Handling.ipynb`
   - Finally, review `Integration_Testing.ipynb`

## Future Improvements
- Implement data persistence using a database
- Enhance user authentication with encryption and multi-factor authentication
- Develop a user interface for easier system interaction
- Integrate comprehensive unit testing

## Statement of Original Work

This project represents my individual effort in designing and implementing a backend system for SL Tech, a fictional EdTech company. The system manages user credentials, course enrollments, and assignments, with a focus on functionality and robustness. I've thoroughly tested the system to ensure it meets the required standards.

While I didn't have extensive experience with Python before starting this project, I relied on my existing knowledge, skills, and experience in system design and planning to execute the project effectively. This foundation enabled me to quickly grasp and apply the concepts taught in this course to create a functional and efficient backend system.

All research, design, and implementation work presented here is my own. Any external code or libraries used have been acknowledged. I've combined my prior experience with the new knowledge and skills gained from this course to create this project

This project was developed as part of the Programming Refresher course in the AI and Machine Learning Bootcamp offered by [Caltech Center for Technology and Management Education](https://ctme.caltech.edu/).

Thank you for reviewing my work.
