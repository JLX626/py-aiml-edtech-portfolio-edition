    "## System Functionalities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Users\n",
    "Users (including learners and instructors) can be added to the system using the `add_user` function. Each user must have a unique user ID, name, email, and password.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Courses\n",
    "Courses can be added to the system using the `add_course` function. Each course must have a unique course ID, course name, and an instructor ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing Enrollments\n",
    "Enrollments can be managed using the `manage_enrollments` function. Learners can be enrolled in or dropped from courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieving Enrolled Learners\n",
    "The `get_enrolled_learners` method retrieves a list of learner IDs enrolled in a specific course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieving Enrolled Courses\n",
    "The `get_enrolled_courses` method retrieves a list of course IDs that a specific learner is enrolled in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes on Limitations and Potential Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- The current implementation does not include data persistence. All data is lost when the program terminates.\n",
    "- User authentication is basic and does not include features such as password encryption or multi-factor authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Improvements\n",
    "- Implement data persistence using a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL) to store user, course, and enrollment data.\n",
    "- Enhance user authentication with password encryption and multi-factor authentication.\n",
    "- Add more detailed logging and error handling.\n",
    "- Implement a user interface for easier interaction with the system.\n",
    "- **Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically build and deploy documentation**: Use tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins to automate the process of generating and deploying documentation. This ensures that the documentation is always up-to-date and easily accessible.\n",
